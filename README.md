# Grimoire-Mixins!

### Disclaimer!

_Maybe, in a distante future someone merge this into a single mod, i am not the one that will do that!_

These mixins are tested ONLY with:
 - [**Grimoire Legacy 1.7.10-1.0.2a**](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Grimoire-legacy/releases/tag/1.7.10-1.0.2a)

But it """""""should""""""" work on any newer version of Grimoire if legacy support is still a thing.

Collection of mixins for the core-mod [Grimoire](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Grimoire)

### What is it?

Grimoire-Mixins are coremods that will be injected inside other mods trying to fix and\or change their natural behavior.

Some modules may require [EventHelper-1.7.10-1.11.jar](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Grimoire-Mixins/raw/master/libs/EventHelper-1.7.10-1.11.jar)

Some modules may require other modules.

##### What is Event helper?

EventHelper is one of the best mods to help other mods work well on thermos/crucible. It helps fire bukkit events inside forge, so, its easy to check for permissions against popular protection plugins like GriefPreventionPlus and WorldGuard

### How to Install?

* 0 - Notice that the majority of these mixins are Server Side Only! The ones who have any Client Fix are pointed out in their own description below.
